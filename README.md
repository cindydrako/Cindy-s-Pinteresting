This is an learning experience for this old bird
I've always been a designer and have always created tools to make work easier or better
back in the day working HR self-taught Dbase4 and created a program so that I can stop doing crazy repetitive data entry and Bonus!! reporting capabilities??
I'm now a project manager by trade but am excited to be flipping the role in my personal time and learning to code
